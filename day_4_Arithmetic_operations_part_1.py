#program for basic arithmetic operations 

#Declare two integer variables
a = 26 # You can change this value
b = 8  # You can change this value

# Perform arithmetic operations
addition = a + b
subtraction = a - b
multiplication = a * b 
division = a / b # This will give a float result

# Print the results

print(f"Addition: {a} + {b} = {addition}")
