# You need to fix the following lines

# This line has a SyntaxError
# print("hello world")

# This line has a NameError
# print("Hello World!")

# The following lines cause a TypeError
# int1 = 100
# str1 = "10"
# print(int1 / int(str1))

# This line is not indented properly. Fix this
# print("Indentation matters in Python")

# You will notice that we have blank lines
# Python doesn't care about these!

# There is extra whitespace inside the print statement 
# Python doesn't care about this
